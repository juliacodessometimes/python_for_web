All code we covered in class is included in the above folders. In the following folders you may find examples for the final application:

**Example 1** is the Language website we have been working on in class.
It shows everything in assignments 1-6, and does not have any forms or clean up:

[final_app_example](https://github.com/juliacodessometimes/python_for_web/tree/main/final_app_example)


**Example 2** is the Pets website we have been working on in the homework.
It follows assignments 1-6, and also follows the testing/cleanup walkthrough and contains a form:

[final_app_example_withforms](https://github.com/juliacodessometimes/python_for_web/tree/main/final_app_example_withforms)

While Example 2 is more of a finished website, Example 1 is all  you need to receive full credit for your final!
